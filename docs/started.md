# Usage

STPDF

You will need to provide it with the directory of all the scans to sort and a directory to copy the files over and sort them,
PhotoSorter does not touch your original files so make sure you have the required disk space.

Then the app starts searching trough that directory and subsequent folders,
when it finds an image, if deskew is checked, the image is rotated and saved directly to the destination
if not it makes a list of all images to copy and copies them over
